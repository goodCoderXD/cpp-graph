# Graph Implementation

For my first C++ project, I'll be implementing a generic graph library that can be
accessed in python. [Implementation Inspiration](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5493474/graph-implementation-c)


One additional goal of this implementation is to be able to interact with it in
Python.

## Objectives:

- Learn C++ development in the real world

- Adjacency List Implementation
- Adjacency Matrix Implementation
- [Implement all the algorithms](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html)
    - BFS
    - DFS
    - Uniform Cost Search
    - Dijkstra's Shortest Paths
    - Bellman-Ford Shortest Paths
    - Johnson's All-Pairs Shortest Paths
    - Kruskal's Min Span Tree
    - Prim's Min Span Tree
    - Connected Components
    - Strongly Connected Components
    - Dynamic Connected Components (using Disjoin Sets)
    - Topological Sort
    - Transpose
    - Reverse Cuthill Mckee Ordering
    - Smallest Last Vertex Ordering
    - Sequential Vertex Coloring

## Python Objectives:

- An old undergrad project of mine was to check out gerrymandering. I want this graph to be able to act as the engine of that project.
- A simple Web API that can interact with the graph.
